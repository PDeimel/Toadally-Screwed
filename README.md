## What is Toadally Screwed?

"Toadally Screwed" is a Standalone/VST3 synthesizer audio-plugin created with the **JUCE Framework** in combination with **Cmake**.
The goal of this plugin is to create a truly scratchy and unlistenable voice which creates actual vowels, not just basic synthesizer sounds.

## Features

* **4 Awesome Oszillators**, each coming with a ready **Preset** to mimic your favourite Toad sound!
* **Live Preview** of the waveform in real-time!
* A complete **ADSR-Envelope** to completely control your sound experience!
* Two **Effects**, a **Reverb** and a **Bitcrusher** to truly simulate the scratchy voice of the mushroom man!
* A mostly functional **Vowel-Slider** which allows to move the sound from a pitched "A" to a deep "U"!
* A neat little **VU-Meter** to at least you show that you are creating a sound!
* Use it **Cross-Platform** as a VST3 Plugin for your favourite DAW!
* Use it as a **Standalone** to unleash your inner Mario, squeezing 'em Shrooms!
